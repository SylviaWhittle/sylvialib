# sylvialib
A library for all my favourite Python scripts.

Sub modules:
- `sylvialib.deep_learning`: A collection of scripts for use in setting up deep learning models.
- `sylvialib.numpy`: A collection of scripts for use in setting up numpy arrays and handling them.
- `sylvialib.plotting`: A collection of plotting scripts for data visualisation. Notably the ability to plot an arbitrary number of plots in a grid with a given width.
